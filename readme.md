### Language: PYTHON
### Framework: FLASK

> ##### Introduction
> Games are not what I would like to do. However, in this work, the logical part fascinated me most of all. The main task in the study of the Flask framework was the study of forms. In this project, both conventional forms and forms created using WTForms.

The game is a classic naval battle from a school notebook :)
There are two options for placing ships to choose from - self-placement and automatic. Selecting the placement of ships manually triggers check functions that check the dimensions and the number of placed ships. Another function checks if there are intersections of ships and if they are placed close to each other (there is no required distance). If an incorrect placement is detected, problem areas are highlighted in color.
